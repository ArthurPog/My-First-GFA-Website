            <h4>Instruction set</h4>
            <p class="definition">All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such as reading data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. The complete list of commands that can be run by a cpu is known as the instruction set.</p>
            
            <h4>Logic gate</h4>
            <p class="definition">It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
